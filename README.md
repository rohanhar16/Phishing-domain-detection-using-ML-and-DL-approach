  <h1>Phishing Website Detection</h1>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    This project aims to detect phishing websites using machine learning models and deep neural networks. Phishing websites are fraudulent websites that mimic legitimate websites to deceive users and steal their sensitive information such as login credentials, credit card numbers, or personal data. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can build models that can accurately identify and flag potential phishing websites, thereby helping to enhance cybersecurity measures and protect users from online threats.
  </p>

  <h2>Dataset Collection</h2>
  <p>
    The dataset used for this project is crucial for training and evaluating the machine learning models. It consists of phishing and legitimate URLs, which are essential in differentiating between genuine and fraudulent websites. The phishing URLs are obtained from the PhishTank service, which is a community-driven website that collects and verifies phishing URLs. The dataset is regularly updated to include the latest phishing URLs. The legitimate URLs are obtained from the University of New Brunswick, which provides a comprehensive dataset comprising benign, spam, phishing, malware, and defacement URLs. This diverse dataset ensures that the models are trained on a wide range of website categories, enabling them to generalize well to real-world scenarios.
  </p>

  <h2>Feature Extraction</h2>
  <p>
    To effectively detect phishing websites, we extract various features from the URLs, which can help capture patterns and characteristics associated with phishing attacks. The features are divided into three categories: URL-based features, domain-based features, and content-based features.
  </p>

  <h3>URL-based features:</h3>
  <p>These features are derived directly from the URL itself. They include the domain of the URL, the length of the URL, the depth of the URL (the number of directories or subdirectories in the URL), the presence of "http/https" in the domain, the usage of URL shortening services (e.g., bit.ly), the presence of hyphens or underscores in the domain, the length of the subdomain, and the presence of certain keywords (e.g., "client," "admin," "login," "server") in the URL.</p>

  <h3>Domain-based features:</h3>
  <p>These features are related to the characteristics of the domain hosting the website. They include the availability of DNS records, which indicates whether the domain is properly registered and configured, the age of the domain, and the end period of the domain registration. These features can provide insights into the legitimacy and trustworthiness of the website.</p>

  <h3>Content-based features:</h3>
  <p>These features are derived from the actual content of the website. They include the presence of IFrame redirection, which is a common technique used in phishing attacks to redirect users to malicious websites, and the presence of website forwarding, which involves automatically redirecting users to another website without their consent. These features can indicate potentially malicious behavior.</p>

  <p>The extraction of these features allows us to create a comprehensive representation of the URLs, capturing both structural and content-related aspects that are relevant for phishing website detection.</p>

  <h2>Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</h2>
  <p>Before training the machine learning models, the dataset undergoes preprocessing steps to ensure its quality and suitability for training. These steps involve dropping irrelevant columns, handling missing or null values, and normalizing the features to bring them to a common scale. This preprocessing helps in optimizing the models' performance and reduces the impact of noisy or inconsistent data.</p>

  <p>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the dataset and understand its characteristics. This involves visualizing the data distribution, analyzing feature correlations, and identifying potential data imbalances or biases. EDA helps in making informed decisions during feature selection, model training, and evaluation.</p>

  <h2>Model Training</h2>
  <p>Several machine learning models are trained on the preprocessed dataset to detect phishing websites. The models used in this project include:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Decision Tree Classifier</li>
    <li>Random Forest Classifier</li>
    <li>XGBoost Classifier</li>
    <li>Logistic Regression</li>
    <li>Support Vector Machines (SVM)</li>
    <li>Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Each model is instantiated with appropriate hyperparameters, fitted with the training data, and evaluated on both the training and test data. The evaluation metrics used include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into the models' performance in terms of correctly classifying phishing and legitimate websites.</p>

  <h2>Model Comparison and Selection</h2>
  <p>After training and evaluating the models, their performance metrics are stored in a dataframe for comparison. The models are compared based on these metrics to identify the most effective model for phishing website detection.</p>

  <p>In our experiments, the XGBoost Classifier achieved the highest accuracy on the test data, indicating its effectiveness in detecting phishing websites. However, the final model selection should consider other metrics as well, depending on the specific requirements and priorities of the application. For example, precision might be more critical if reducing false positives (flagging legitimate websites as phishing) is a priority, while recall might be more crucial if identifying as many phishing websites as possible is the main goal.</p>

  <p>Once the model is selected, it can be saved for future use, allowing the detection of phishing websites in real-time or batch processing scenarios.</p>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>To use the trained XGBoost model for detecting phishing websites, follow these steps:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Load the saved XGBoost model using the pickle library or any other suitable method.</li>
    <li>Extract the features from the URL of a website using the featureExtraction function or the relevant feature extraction method from your implementation.</li>
    <li>Reshape the extracted features into a 2D array or any suitable input format required by the loaded model.</li>
    <li>Pass the reshaped features to the loaded model's predict method to obtain the prediction label.</li>
    <li>The prediction label will indicate whether the website is classified as phishing or legitimate.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Here's an example code snippet:</p>

  <pre>
    <code>
import pickle
import numpy as np

# Load the XGBoost model from file
loaded_model = pickle.load(open("XGBoostClassifier.pickle.dat", "rb"))

def detect_phishing_website(url):
    # Extract features from the URL
    features = featureExtraction(url)

    # Reshape the features into a 2D array
    features = np.array(features).reshape(1, -1)

    # Predict the label using the loaded model
    label = loaded_model.predict(features)

    return label[0]
    </code>
  </pre>
